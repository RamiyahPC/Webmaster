                <h2>Mars</h2>
                <p>Mars is a planet with a distinctive reddish appearance, caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface.
                    Its diameter is about half that of Earth, with a surface area similar to that of Earth's dry land.
                    The planet has numerous craters, canyons, and volcanic features, including the largest volcano in
                    the solar system, </p>

                <h2>Venus</h2>
                <p>Venus is a planet with a bright and dense atmosphere, primarily composed of carbon dioxide. Venus has
                    a diameter similar to that of Earth, and its surface is rocky and dotted with volcanoes, mountains,
                    and craters. Its dense atmosphere also produces a yellowish-white appearance, with thick clouds that
                    obscure the planet's surface from view. Venus has no moons, and it rotates slowly in the opposite
                    direction to most planets in the solar system.</p>

                <h2>Earth</h2>
                <p>Earth is a planet with a diverse and dynamic surface, consisting of mountains, valleys, oceans,
                    deserts, forests, and more. Its atmosphere is primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen, with trace
                    amounts of other gases, and is responsible for producing the blue coloration of the planet. It has one large moon, which is responsible for the tides on Earth. From space,

                <h2>Pluto</h2>
                <p>Pluto is only about two-thirds the size of
                    Earth's moon. Its surface is composed primarily of rock and ice, and it has a reddish-brown
                    coloration
                    Pluto also has a system of five known moons, the largest of which,
                    Charon, is roughly half the size of Pluto itself..</p>
